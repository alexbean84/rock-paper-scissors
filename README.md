# rock-paper-scissors
Hello! This is a Rock Paper Scissors game that I made in order to
display my freshly acquired JavaScript skills. This game consists
of five rounds that need to be won by either the user or the
computer so as to become the winner of the game itself. The
project first started as a game which could be played only from
the console, but now it has a user interface as well.

This is Project: Rock Paper Scissors from The Odin Project https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors
